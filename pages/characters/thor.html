                                <h4>If I had a Hammer</h4>

                                <p>Born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled Asgard, Thor grew
                                    into a mighty warrior and protector of his home and people. Thought to be rash and even
                                    reckless by his father, Thor nevertheless looked forward to the day of his ascension
                                    to the throne. But, his adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to ensure that day never
                                    arrived. He manipulated Thor into attacking the Frost Giants, legendary adversaries of
                                    the Asgardians and Loki’s people, and Odin—hoping to teach his son humility—divested
                                    Thor of his magic hammer Mjolnir and banished him to Midgard, the realm also known as
                                    Earth.
                                </p>

                                <p>Alone and unable to return to Asgard, Thor met scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig
                                    in the midst of their investigation into strange activity near a small New Mexico town.
                                    While his brother struggled with the limitations of mortals on Earth, Loki worked to
                                    ensure his own seizure of the Asgardian throne and planned to allow the Frost Giant king—his
                                    real father—into Asgard to slay Odin in his sleep. Back on Earth, Thor sacrificed himself
                                    to save the town from destruction and in doing so, impressed Odin enough to restore him
                                    to full Asgardian power.</p>

                                <p>With Mjolnir once again in his grasp and the admiration and possible love of Jane Foster,
                                    Thor returned to his home, routed the Frost Giants, and defeated Loki in battle. Chagrined
                                    at his loss and stinging from Odin’s condemnation, Loki chose to fall away from Asgard
                                    into a strange warp in space while Thor and their father looked on. Though happy to be
                                    back in Asgard, Thor’s thoughts were filled with adventure on Midgard with Jane Foster.</p>

                                <h4>The Trappings of a God</h4>

                                <p>Like all Asgardians, Thor possesses great strength, endurance, stamina, and long life,
                                    but it is his command over the stormy forces of nature that separate him from his brethren
                                    as a true son of Odin the Allfather. Thor can call down lightning and thunder at will
                                    and utilize them like a blacksmith uses his tools to work iron and steel—bending and
                                    shaping them into weapons. Once he believed it was his hammer Mjolnir that granted him
                                    these powers, but in truth the ability has rested within him the whole time.</p>

                                <p>For nearly a thousand years Thor holds Mjolnir’s grip in battle, a true companion if ever
                                    there was one. The incredible hammer was forged by Odin from the heart of a dying star
                                    and gifted to his son for his exclusive use. Odin even places an enchantment on it when
                                    he banishes Thor to Midgard, one that would only allow a “worthy” person to lift it and
                                    possess the power of the god of thunder. While Thor is with the Avengers on Earth, his
                                    comrades all try to handle the hammer, but only Captain America could move it slightly,
                                    a feat that its owner takes notice of.</p>

                                <p>After Mjolnir’s destruction by Hela, Thor forges a new weapon when the threat of Thanos
                                    arises. With the help of Eitri, a Dwarven smithy of Nidavellir, and an adolescent Groot,
                                    Thor crafts Stormbreaker, an immense axe with some of the same properties as his hammer,
                                    along with the ability to open the Bifrost.</p>

                                <h4>The Dark Half</h4>

                                <p>Thor develops a number of adversaries in his quest to protect Asgard, and also Midgard,
                                    from harm.</p>

                                <p>The relationship between Thor and Loki may rightfully be categorized as “complicated.”
                                    Raised as brothers, the two men know each other better than anyone, yet have been continually
                                    at odds, sometimes to notably extreme degrees. Loki’s scheming nature and unbridled egoism
                                    comes between him and Thor many times over, causing trouble that has literally impacted
                                    entire worlds. Still Thor, overcoming multiple betrayals, believes the man he calls brother
                                    can change and embrace the light. And it seems Thor’s belief in his is redeemed when
                                    Loki gives his life to protect Thor from Thanos—leaving Thor to deeply mourn his brother’s
                                    loss.
                                </p>

                                <p>Among Thor’s more clear-cut enemies stand Frost Giant King Laufey, Surtur the Fire Giant,
                                    the dark elf Malekith, and Thor’s own half-sister Hela, the so-called goddess of death,
                                    all of whom have ill intent towards Asgard. Thor also finds himself imprisoned for a
                                    time on Sakaar by the Grandmaster.</p>

                                <p>Thanos earns Thor’s immense hatred after the tyrant’s crusade wipes out many Asgardians
                                    and kills loved ones of the god of thunder, making things very personal for him.</p>

                                <h4>Warriors All</h4>

                                <p>Thor grows up surrounded by warriors and fighters, and it is among that august group that
                                    he can count the majority of his close companions.</p>

                                <p>Heimdall, all-seeing keeper of the Bifrost Bridge, offers Thor advice and counsel whenever
                                    he requests it, and many times when he does not. Thor treasures his friendship with Heimdall,
                                    and they often fight back to back against those who threaten their home. Likewise, both
                                    Sif and the Warriors Three (Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun) are valued comrades of Thor,
                                    battling at his side over the years. They take pride in the fact that they always had
                                    each other’s backs in a fight, until the Warriors Three perish during Hela’s siege on
                                    Asgard.
                                </p>

                                <p>On Earth, Jane Foster is a warrior in her own right, a woman who stands up for what she
                                    believes in and never backs down no matter how big a challenge she faces. These traits
                                    impress Thor from the moment he meets the young scientist, and their admiration for each
                                    other quickly grows into love. Whenever Thor is away from Earth, he counts the minutes
                                    until he returns to Jane Foster’s side. Unfortunately, the two part ways eventually.
                                    The Asgardian also feels a bond with Dr. Erik Selvig, Foster’s partner, and he looks
                                    to the scientist many times for insight not only into deep matters, but also for his
                                    knowledge of the world.
                                </p>

                                <p>Of all of Thor’s Avengers teammates, Steve Rogers, Captain America, is perhaps the one
                                    that he trusts most with his life, though he will always remain a faithful companion
                                    to the others, including Tony Stark and Bruce Banner. The latter, in fact, more recently
                                    becomes a closer friend to Thor, as Banner’s alter ego the Hulk battles Thor in the gladiatorial
                                    arena on Sakaar and fights beside him in Asgard.</p>

                                <p>Thor also makes the acquaintance of one of the fabled Valkyrie on Sakaar, a warrior woman
                                    self-exiled from Asgard and her duties as one of its protectors. Though she at first
                                    opposes everything Thor stands for, she comes around to his desire to return to Asgard
                                    and vanquish its conqueror, Hela. In doing so, she becomes yet another staunch ally of
                                    the thunder god’s, as does the Kronan named Korg, who also fights with Thor on both Sakaar
                                    and Asgard.</p>
