                                <h4>Along Came a Spider</h4>

                                <p>A bite from a spider somehow granted teenager Peter Parker its arachnid abilities and
                                    instead of using them for personal gain, he decided to help others with them. An orphan
                                    living with his aunt, May Parker, the boy chose to wear a mask while fighting crime so
                                    as not to burden her with his actions.</p>

                                <p>Calling himself Spider-Man and sporting a pair of web-shooting devices he’d constructed,
                                    Parker wound up in internet videos which attracted the attention of Tony Stark. The billionaire
                                    industrialist deduced Spider-Man’s secret identity and approached Parker at his and May’s
                                    home in Queens, New York with a request for aid from the hero in an upcoming confrontation
                                    with Captain America and a group of other rogue Avengers and associates. Parker was initially
                                    hesitant to even admit his secret career as Spider-Man, but the thrill of adventure and
                                    Stark’s talk of responsibility drew him in and he accepted the invitation, as well as
                                    a new, high-tech costume and web-shooters.</p>

                                <h4>Does Whatever a Spider Can</h4>

                                <p>Peter Parker’s gifts from the spider bite include enhanced strength, stamina, and agility,
                                    as well as the ability to cling to nearly any surface by his hands and feet, and an internal
                                    “alarm” of sorts that warns him of impending danger. When in costume he becomes a figure
                                    in motion, leaping and jumping about with a steady stream of wisecracks.</p>

                                <p>The Spider-Man suit designed by Tony Stark includes wrist-worn web-shooters (adapted from
                                    Peter’s own invention) that emit lines of synthetic “webbing” capable of supporting great
                                    weight with a high-degree of holding power. In addition, the suit provides various optical
                                    powers, a voice-changer, a drone tracking device, and some protection against outside
                                    elements. When not in use, the suit appears as loose, thin cloth, but when donned, it
                                    adheres tightly to the body and stretches easily to almost any movement by the wearer.</p>

                                <p>Recently, Parker acquires a specialized suit of armor from Stark that features many qualities
                                    of the inventor’s own Iron Man suits, including enhanced protective layering, optics,
                                    internal air supply, along with a set of four spider-like extra “arms” that answer to
                                    the teenager’s mental commands.</p>

                                <h4>To Squash a Spider</h4>

                                <p>Spider-Man has yet to attract a sizable Rogues Gallery, but his first real Super Villain
                                    adversary is Adrian Toomes, the Vulture.</p>

                                <p>Over the course of Spider-Man’s interactions with the Vulture, he advanced from a nuisance
                                    in Toomes’ eyes to a true obstruction in the man’s schemes. Toomes also perhaps saw a
                                    bit of himself in Spider-Man, albeit at a younger age. Unfortunately, the Vulture discovered
                                    his foe’s secret identity and was able to initially warn Parker off with threats toward
                                    his family and friends. But, the young man’s sense of responsibility and justice outweighed
                                    any fear and he did everything within his power to ensure that Toomes never flew again.
                                    Now in prison, the Vulture still harbors Spider-Man’s secret, though he had decided to
                                    keep that to himself as an apparent sign of respect towards his enemy.</p>

                                <p>In addition to the Vulture himself, two of his associates may also still cause trouble
                                    for Spider-Man: Herman Schultz, AKA the Shocker, who wields a powerful gauntlet inherited
                                    from his late colleague, Jackson Brice, and Mac Gargan, a dangerous criminal who was
                                    injured in a confrontation with Spider-Man. Both men have been incarcerated, but Gargan
                                    in particular seems eager to enact his revenge on New York’s young champion.</p>

                                <p>When Thanos made his play for the Infinity Stones, Spider-Man, coming to Iron Man’s aid,
                                    placed himself in direct opposition to both Thanos and those who serve him.</p>

                                <h4>Classmates, Comrades, and Kin</h4>

                                <p>May Parker took her nephew in to raise him as if he was her own son and has instilled
                                    values in Peter Parker that serve him well. So close are the two that he worries over
                                    hurting May with his Spider-Man activities and feels the pain of lying to her. May is
                                    easygoing to some extent, but is quick to let her nephew know when she is unhappy with
                                    any situation he may be involved in.</p>

                                <p>As a student at the Midtown School of Science and Technology, Parker enjoys only a very
                                    small circle of friends, partially due to his extracurricular time as Spider-Man. His
                                    best friend is his classmate Ned, who discovers Spider-Man’s secret identity by accident
                                    and is in complete awe over the details of Parker’s costumed career. During Spider-Man’s
                                    first real adventure involving a major adversary, Ned provides valuable support, despite
                                    his seemingly bumbling demeanor.</p>
