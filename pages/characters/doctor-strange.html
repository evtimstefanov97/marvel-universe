                                <h4>Occult Origins</h4>

                                <p>Vain, egotistic surgeon Stephen Strange lost the use of his hands in a horrific auto accident
                                    caused by his own recklessness. In turn, he lost his fortune through a series of costly,
                                    complicated and experimental surgeries and therapies in an attempt to save his livelihood.
                                    In the end, destitute and desperate, he sought a cure far off the beaten path of modern
                                    medicine.</p>

                                <p>In Nepal, after being saved from muggers by the powerful sorcerer Mordo, Strange met the
                                    person who had taught Mordo—Earth’s Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient One, who held many
                                    mysteries of the Old World, including the potential to heal Strange’s hands. The Ancient
                                    One refused to guide Strange through the process until he relinquished his selfishness
                                    and opened his mind to a higher truth. Having done so, the doctor began to learn of the
                                    Multiverse and the ancient science of magic, as well as forbidden knowledge the Ancient
                                    One was not inclined to share.</p>

                                <h4>Tools of the Trade</h4>

                                <p>A Master of the Mystic Arts, Doctor Strange has phenomenally powerful magical abilities
                                    that enable him to skillfully conjure myriad spells. Strange has been able to use his
                                    spells to bind opponents and create complex shields and barriers, among many other uses
                                    for both defense and attack. Strange is also adept at astral projection, sending his
                                    astral self away from his body and allowing him to observe events without the knowledge
                                    of those present.</p>

                                <p>Strange discovers that certain artifacts can bolster magical spells and extend their benefits.
                                    At the New York Sanctum, he is adopted by the Cloak of Levitation, a seemingly sentient
                                    cape that not only protects him, but also fights for him. The doctor also makes use of
                                    Sling Rings to create portals to cross great distances and to enter other realms.</p>

                                <p>Arguably, the Eye of Agamotto provides the greatest source of power to Strange. In truth
                                    the Infinity Stone known as the Time Stone, the Eye possesses the incalculable ability
                                    to control time itself. With it, Strange can alter time around objects, locations or
                                    other beings, moving forward and backward through their existence. It can also be used
                                    to trap enemies in time loops, as well as giving Strange the ability to look forward
                                    into potential futures.</p>

                                <h4>The Gentle Art of Making Enemies</h4>

                                <p>Strange accelerates his mystical learning by mastering the use of his astral form, but
                                    as he dips deeper into magic, he encounters Kaecilius, a former student of the Ancient
                                    One and a disciple of Dormammu, a powerful entity from the Dark Dimension. Though still
                                    a relative novice, Strange opposes Kaecilius and his followers when they reveal their
                                    plans to bring Dormammu to Earth for utter destruction. At this same time, Strange also
                                    learns of Earth’s magical hierarchy, including a trio of Sanctums placed around the globe
                                    and overseen by Masters to protect the planet from magical threats.</p>

                                <p>Later, Thanos and his mission to acquire all six Infinity Stones poses a direct threat
                                    to Strange and the Time Stone in his possession, putting Strange into conflict with Thanos’
                                    followers Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian as well.</p>

                                <h4>Seeking Aid</h4>

                                <p>In his struggle with Kaecilius and Dormammu, Strange finds himself aided by Mordo, another
                                    accomplished student of the Ancient One, and Wong, a Master who watched over the Ancient
                                    One’s library in Nepal. Mordo proves himself a staunch ally until he witnesses his teacher’s
                                    use of magic she herself had forbidden and loses faith in her guidance. After Strange’s
                                    defeat of Dormammu, Wong travels with him to a Sanctum in New York City to stand at his
                                    side for the uncertain times ahead.</p>

                                <p>The Ancient One falls due to the treachery of Kaecilius, and though she wielded dark magic
                                    to further the cause of good, she dies urging Stephen Strange to continue his magical
                                    studies and become a champion for Earth.</p>

                                <p>Doctor Christine Palmer and Strange once dated, and she offers him assistance and comfort
                                    in the wake of his accident, only to be rejected by him at his darkest point. He does
                                    care for and trust her, as later, Strange seeks her medical expertise when he himself—and
                                    later the Ancient One—are injured during his battles. He also reveals his magical abilities
                                    to her and apologizes for how he’d once acted.</p>
