                                <h4>Enigma</h4>

                                <p>Natasha Romanoff was trained from a young age to cultivate a very specific set of skills
                                    in a Russian facility called the Red Room. There she honed the skills that would turn
                                    her into a human warrior who continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with super soldiers,
                                    Asgardians and people in armored suits. However, she eventually eschewed her KGB masters,
                                    switched allegiances and began working for the good guys.</p>

                                <h4>Trained by the Best</h4>

                                <p>Exhibiting no super human abilities, the Black Widow boasts ultimate human levels of strength,
                                    agility, and stamina. She is extensively trained to near perfection in a variety of fighting
                                    styles, such as karate, judo, kung fu, and wrestling, and with all manner of weapons—both
                                    traditional and high-tech—combined with her background in gymnastics, acrobatics, and
                                    ballet to always accomplish her mission.</p>

                                <p>She can use a simple handgun just as well as a Chitauri battle staff or even Captain America's
                                    shield. Her signature weapons include dual batons, a pair of Glock 26s and the Black
                                    Widow’s Bite—bracelets that discharge electricity. Romanoff also displays great skill
                                    when it comes to hacking in computers and technological systems to dig for information
                                    or regaining control.</p>

                                <h4>Beware Her Bite</h4>

                                <p>Many of the Black Widow's enemies were assigned to her, first by the KGB and then by S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>

                                <p>In more recent years, though, she assists in taking down Ivan Vanko, Justin Hammer, the
                                    Chitauri, HYDRA, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, and Helmut Zemo among others. And those
                                    are just the targets we know about.</p>

                                <p>Some notable foes include, the Asgardian god of mischief, Loki and Ultron. She proves
                                    a formidable opponent to Loki, who assumes that he is able to manipulate her when he
                                    recalls her past misdeeds. Instead, it is Natasha who gets the upper hand on him, determining
                                    that he plans to release the Hulk as part of his plan. When Ultron captures her, she
                                    still undermines him to give the Avengers her location, helping them in their plan to
                                    defeat him.</p>

                                <p>Following the events of the Sokovia Accords and Civil War, Romanoff is later forced to come

                                    Earth in a quest to gain all six Infinity Stones, which would could instantaneously eliminate
                                    half of all life in the Universe with a snap of a finger.</p>

                                <h4>Allies Declassified</h4>

                                <p>Although she was raised to be autonomous and without attachments, the Black Widow has
                                    proven herself an exceptional team player.</p>

                                <p>Fellow agent and Avenger Clint Barton seems to be Natasha Romanoff's best friend. She
                                    feels she owes him a debt for the role he played in bringing her over from the KGB, instead
                                    of eliminating her as a target. She seems to care for him quite deeply, as she bargains
                                    for his release when Loki has him under his control. Also, at first, she is the only
                                    Avenger to know the existence of Hawkeye’s family.</p>
