                                <h4>Awakening the Witch</h4>

                                <p>Sokovian native Wanda Maximoff and her twin brother Pietro survived an explosion in their
                                    apartment building that killed both of their parents. Another missile landed, but did
                                    not explode. It terrorized them for days as they remained stuck in the rubble, with the
                                    deadly device in front of them, the name Stark emblazed on its side.</p>

                                <p>Years later, they both volunteered to undergo genetic experimentation overseen by HYDRA’s
                                    Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, using Loki’s scepter, to potentially give them powers. One
                                    of the few survivors of the experiments, along with her brother, Wanda found herself
                                    with a variety of abilities. Alongside Pietro, Wanda went on to use these abilities to
                                    help the robot Ultron, who shared her disdain for Tony Stark.</p>

                                <p>However, when she and Pietro discovered the true nature of Ultron’s plans, they switched
                                    allegiances and joined the fight against him, putting Wanda on the path to become an
                                    Avenger.</p>

                                <h4>Scarlet Power</h4>

                                <p>The full extent of Scarlet Witch’s considerable powers has likely not been fully documented
                                    as of yet.</p>

                                <p>As her powers likely come at least in part from the Mind Stone inside of Loki’s scepter,
                                    Wanda’s abilities include telekinesis, energy manipulation, and some form of neuroelectric
                                    interfacing that allows her to both read thoughts and also give her targets waking nightmares.
                                    Under the tutelage of Avengers Captain America and Black Widow, she has learned not only
                                    to hone her abilities further, but also hand-to-hand combat and tactical skills.</p>

                                <h4>The Witch List</h4>

                                <p>Wanda Maximoff’s enemies shift significantly as she changes allegiances.</p>

                                <p>Because Stark missiles kill her parents and nearly kill her and her twin brother Pietro,
                                    Wanda spends much of her youth hating Tony Stark. Her initial ally, Ultron, plays off
                                    of that rage and manipulates the twins into working for him against the Avengers. However,
                                    she comes to see the genocidal Ultron as the true enemy and helps stop his evil scheme.
                                    While the relationship between her and Stark does not develop into friendship, they do
                                    become teammates as part of the Avengers.</p>

                                <p>Wanda later finds a fearsome foe in Thanos, whose goal to gain all six Infinity Stone sets
                                    him on a path to Vision, who holds the Mind Stone. Thanos’ quest pits the Scarlet Witch
                                    against two of his followers, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive, and eventually Thanos
                                    himself. Wanda defeats Proxima Midnight to defend her allies, Black Widow and Okoye.
                                    Although Wanda opposes Thanos’ goal to end half the life in the universe, he is a much
                                    more personal enemy, given her love for Vision and her desire to save his life. She stands
                                    staunchly against the Mad Titan in attempt to prevent him from taking the Mind Stone
                                    for himself.</p>

                                <h4>Avenging Friends</h4>

                                <p>As she becomes an Avenger, Wanda Maximoff develops a good relationship with many in the
                                    Super Hero community.</p>

                                <p>Her first and foremost ally is her twin brother, Pietro Maximoff, who stands by and tries
                                    to protect her in the wake of their parents’ death. After gaining powers from Baron von
                                    Strucker, the Maximoff twins ally themselves with Ultron before fully understanding his
                                    villainous plans. Wanda, along with Pietro, switches sides and works with the Avengers,
                                    fighting alongside Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Iron Man to oppose the mechanical
                                    monster. She is particularly inspired by Hawkeye, who sees a lot of potential in her
                                    and becomes a mentor to her. She grieves deeply when Pietro perishes in the fight against
                                    Ultron.</p>
