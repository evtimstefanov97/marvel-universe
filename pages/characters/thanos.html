                                <h4>For Death’s Sake</h4>

                                <p>A native of the planet Titan, Thanos saw the danger his people were in from overpopulation
                                    and suggested a severe solution—the elimination of half the population, at random and
                                    without prejudice, in order to make life better for the planet as a whole. He was shunned
                                    as a madman, but his planet did indeed eventually die, lacking the resources needed to
                                    keep up with the demands.</p>

                                <p>Firmly believing that the universe at large was in the same danger as Titan, Thanos grew
                                    to power as a force bringing death and destruction from planet to planet, with untold
                                    legions of soldiers and servants at his beck and call. Infamous for annihilating entire
                                    races in service of depopulating what he believes to be an overcrowded universe, he most
                                    often works through surrogates to achieve his goals, but has been known to take a personal
                                    hand in special circumstances.</p>

                                <p>More than once, Thanos took a child from a galactic species he’d decimated and raised
                                    them as his own. Some of these children have been tutored in the arts of assassination
                                    and war, making them among the deadliest killers imaginable. Thanos has also given powerful
                                    artifacts to individuals who he believes will use them to spread the cause of death in
                                    certain important spots among the galaxies.</p>

                                <p>Thanos went on to have a great interest in acquiring the Infinity Stones, six objects
                                    of immense power scattered throughout the universe, and has had the Infinity Gauntlet
                                    built in order to harness their power.</p>

                                <h4>A Titan among Men</h4>

                                <p>Physically, Thanos stands head and shoulders above the average human or humanoid, with
                                    powerful muscles, a broad face, and a purple-hued skintone. He often wears a protective
                                    suit of armor and his strength is such that he has been physically able to battle—and
                                    defeat—the likes of the Hulk.</p>

                                <p>Not known to use much in the way of personal weapons, the one extremely notable artifact
                                    he keeps with him is the Infinity Gauntlet. Made from Uru metal on Nidavellir by Eitri,
                                    under duress from Thanos, the Infinity Gauntlet enables its wearer to harness the power
                                    of each Infinity Stone added to it. Once it holds all six stones, it becomes the most
                                    powerful item in the universe.</p>

                                <h4>A Big Target</h4>

                                <p>Thanks to his actions, the list of those who consider Thanos an enemy is vast, though
                                    he has gained a few particularly notable adversaries. First and foremost among them would
                                    be his daughters Nebula and Gamora, after they turn against him and seek his end by their
                                    own hands. Nebula’s Guardians of the Galaxy teammate, the warrior Drax, also hopes to
                                    be Thanos’ killer, as he seeks revenge for the deaths of his wife and daughter.</p>

                                <p>The entire Nova Corps, the intergalactic police force of the Xandarians, also opposes
                                    Thanos as he quests for the Infinity Stones, with the Guardians of the Galaxy serving
                                    as somewhat of an extension of their protective bubble.</p>

                                <p>After killing Heimdall, Loki, and other Asgardians, Thanos acquires the personal wrath
                                    of Thor, Asgardian god of thunder. In the wake of dispatching Gamora, he earns the loathing
                                    of Peter Quill, Star-Lord. Despite no longer officially functioning as a team, most Super
                                    Heroes who previously served as Avengers, along with allies like Doctor Strange, Spider-Man,
                                    and Black Panther, also stand against Thanos as he gathers every Infinity Stone.</p>

                                <h4>The Children and the Lackeys</h4>

                                <p>Thanos does not seem to have any genuine friendships or close confidants, mainly interacting
                                    with beings under his thrall and command, along with those he deems his children. For
                                    a while, he was often accompanied by a high-ranking servant referred to as the Other,
                                    an individual who spoke for his master and was able to issue threats on Thanos’ behalf.
                                    The Other seemingly enjoyed a position that allowed him to deliver unfortunate news to
                                    his master without apparent punishment, though Thanos also expressed no displeasure at
                                    his demise.</p>

                                <p>The assassin Gamora and warrior Nebula are raised as Thanos’ daughters after their respective
                                    races are targeted by the Titan. While Thanos seems dismissive towards Nebula, expressing
                                    no qualms about torturing her, he believes he truly loves Gamora, hoping she will one
                                    day succeed him as ruler. Eventually, both women break away from his abusive rearing
                                    to make their own way in the universe and become his opponents. The Kree warlord Ronan
                                    the Accuser also initially does Thanos’ bidding in the search for the Orb, but when Ronan
                                    realizes its true power, he begins to act on his own to claim it for himself.</p>

                                <p>During his push to acquire the Infinity Stones, Thanos commands a powerful foursome of galactic
                                    assassins: Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight, Corvus Glaive, and Cull Obsidian, referred to
                                    as the Children of Thanos—to do his bidding across the galaxies. Totally devoted to their
                                    master, they hold an almost religious fervor in serving Thanos and aiding him in gathering
                                    the Stones. When Thanos learns of Maw’s death, he expresses some regret over the loss.</p>
